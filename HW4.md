1. What you planned on doing for this homework deadline. (Copy + pasted from your previous document)

This is copied and pasted from previous document:
When HW2 is due, we will have a detailed class structure.

When HW3 is due, we will have a working database class.

When HW4 is due, we will have a working user and superuser class.

When HW5 is due, we will have a checkpoint/integration for the above 3 done.

GUI and finished product will be done by the final.

***OUR GOAL WAS TO HAVE A WORKING USER AND SUPERUSER FOR THIS CLASS and to start merging database to GUI***

2. What you actually accomplished for this deadline.
***We have the minimum viable user and superuser working. Superuser inherits from user class and is able to do everything user can do in addition to delete users.We also finished integrating get request,post request, and put request buttons on GUI. We managed to integrate the database we created last checkpoint to GUI. In essence, we managed to stay on track to our deadline.***  

  a) Note any differences and explain why they occurred. Prefer honesty over excuses.  
***There were no differences.***  

3. What you had planned to do for the next deadline.  
***For next deadline, we are planning to finish integrate user and superuser class to GUI as well as start integrating the entire code. User can sign up or log in and after doing so, based on the priviledge the user has, they will be able to make get,post,put,and delete requests. Admins will be able to delete users. This will all happen in GUI.***    

  a) Any changes you would like to make to this plan for the next deadline and the reasoning behind each change.  
NOTE: We are thinking that if we have time, we could show the difference in performance with btree we found online vs binary search tree we have in interacting with our data.
