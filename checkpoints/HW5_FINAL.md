1. What you planned on doing for this homework deadline. (Copy + pasted from your previous document)  
From the last checkpoint, we wrote:  
***For next deadline, we are planning to write unit tests for the database class' methods, such as searching, deleting, and inserting using the Catch2 library. Moreover, we will also have unit tests for the UI components using the Qt Test framework in order to see if certain UI components are working, such as text fields being properly filled and certain windows showing when they should.***

2. What you actually accomplished for this deadline.  
***We managed to finish the unit tests for the Database class and the unit tests for the UI components.***  

  a) Note any differences and explain why they occurred. Prefer honesty over excuses.  
***There were no differences.***  

3. What you had planned to do for the next deadline.  
***Nothing left to do.***    

  a) Any changes you would like to make to this plan for the next deadline and the reasoning behind each change.  
***Yes. Our plan is to have a nice break.***
