1. What you planned on doing for this homework deadline. (Copy + pasted from your previous document)  
From the last checkpoint we wrote:  
***"For next deadline, we are planning to finish integrate user and superuser class to GUI as well as finish integrating the the database code into the GUI. User can sign up or log in and after doing so, based on the priviledge the user has, they will be able to make get,post,put,and delete requests. Admins will be able to delete users. This will all happen in GUI."***

2. What you actually accomplished for this deadline.  
***We managed to essentially get all of the GUI fully functional and implemented, which includes working database operations, being able to handle nonadmin and admin users, and working login/signup page. All of these have working UI as well.***  

  a) Note any differences and explain why they occurred. Prefer honesty over excuses.  
***There were no differences.***  

3. What you had planned to do for the next deadline.  
***For next deadline, we are planning to write unit tests for the database class' methods, such as searching, deleting, and inserting using the Catch2 library. Moreover, we will also have unit tests for the UI components using the Qt Test framework in order to see if certain UI components are working, such as text fields being properly filled and certain windows showing when they should.***    

  a) Any changes you would like to make to this plan for the next deadline and the reasoning behind each change.  
***There aren't any changes we are planning to do.***
