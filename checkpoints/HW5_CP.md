1. What you planned on doing for this homework deadline. (Copy + pasted from your previous document)

This is copied and pasted from previous document:
When HW2 is due, we will have a detailed class structure.

When HW3 is due, we will have a working database class.

When HW4 is due, we will have a working user and superuser class.

When HW5 is due, we will have a checkpoint/integration for the above 3 done.

GUI and finished product will be done by the final.

***For this checkpoint, we planned to have the REST api calls fully functional along with their corresponding UI components. Besides this, we also planned to have the login and sign up page completed.***

2. What you actually accomplished for this deadline.  
***We managed to essentially get all of the GUI fully functional and implemented, which includes working database operations, being able to handle nonadmin and admin users, and working login/signup page. All of these have working UI as well.***  

  a) Note any differences and explain why they occurred. Prefer honesty over excuses.  
***There were no differences.***  

3. What you had planned to do for the next deadline.  
***For next deadline, we are planning to write unit tests for the database class' methods, such as searching, deleting, and inserting using the Catch2 library. Moreover, we will also have unit tests for the UI components using the Qt Test framework in order to see if certain UI components are working, such as text fields being properly filled and certain windows showing when they should.***    

  a) Any changes you would like to make to this plan for the next deadline and the reasoning behind each change.  
***There aren't any changes we are planning to do.***
